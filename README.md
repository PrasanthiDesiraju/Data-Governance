# Data-Governance

What is it ?

A framework that helps Organizations understand and value the data they deal with ! A council to establish accountability to answer all the questions about data -  how/what/why/howlong/consent , practically every detail about data being collected and stored  !

Data governance is a critical differentiator to maximize profitability, ensure customer satisfaction and reduce regulatory risks. Data is to be considered as an "Asset" that helps Organizations grow and create a competitive edge. 

Why is it important ? 
 - The rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the risk of having negative consequences if generated from bad/low- quality data.
 - With increase in digital foot print - there is an icreased risk of data leaks and potential repurtaion loss if not adhered to ethical and legal requirements.

This repository contains a collection of documents describing the best data governance strategies and how companies can benefit by embedding data governance and ethics into the business processes. ( These were created as a group project for the course - MSDS-485)
